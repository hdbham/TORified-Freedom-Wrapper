# Inspired by The Freedom Wrapper

The Freedom Wrapper Project is an Open Source and Free Android source code project. The project has moved to an organization page at: https://github.com/The-Freedom-Wrapper-Project

## Reimagined with Tor

#### Majority of the sourcecode recompiled and stripped down from Orbot with jtorctl library

Orbot is a freely licensed open-source application developed for the Android platform. It acts as a front-end to the Tor binary application, and also provides an HTTP Proxy for connecting web browsers and other HTTP client applications into the Tor SOCKS interface.

jtorctl Â· A Java library for controlling a Tor instance via its control port.

#### This branch will always be used to provide a critical use case for wrapper:
Until forked elsewhere, this will redirect to an NGO that provides pregnant-capable people with medical services via telehealth.

Tor protects your privacy on the internet by hiding the connection 
between your Internet address and the services you use. We believe Tor
is reasonably secure, but please ensure you read the instructions and
configure it properly. Learn more at https://torproject.org/
