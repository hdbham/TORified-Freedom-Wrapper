# Reimagined with TOR

This is native Android `TorService` built on the Tor shared library built for
Android.  The included _libtor.so_ binaries can also be used directly as a tor
daemon.  Binaries are available on Maven Central:

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'info.guardianproject:tor-android:0.4.6.10'
    implementation 'info.guardianproject:jtorctl:0.4.5.7'
}
```

Tor protects your privacy on the internet by hiding the connection 
between your Internet address and the services you use. We believe Tor
is reasonably secure, but please ensure you read the instructions and
configure it properly. Learn more at https://torproject.org/
